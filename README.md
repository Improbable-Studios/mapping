# How to run this demo in 4 simple steps

### Step 1

Install Unity3D:

http://unity3d.com/unity/download


### Step 2

Download and unzip the latest version of the demo project files:

https://github.com/Improbable-Studios/mapping/archive/master.zip


### Step 3

Copy the `assets/` folder from your sync-ed **Google Drive** folder into your extracted demo project folder `mapping-master/Assets/` and rename it into `Resources`. The final result should look like this:

`mapping-master/Assets/Resources/characters/` etc.


### Step 4

Open the file `mapping-master/Assets/Scenes/MappingDemo` by double clicking on it. After it's finished loading (it'll take awhile the first time), click on the **"PLAY"** button at the top and middle of the launched application.

The demo should be running now!

Also, feel free to **Create Shortcut** of that file and put it on your desktop if you're too lazy to navigate the folders.


# Some tips for those running the demo...

1. In the bottom window of the project application, there are two tabs: *Project* and *Console*. Click on **Console** and you can see the error messages my code generates. It could help you find problematic files.
2. In the left window of the project application, there is an item called **Grid**. Click on that to bring up its properties in the right window of the application. Now, try ticking the checkbox next to the item called **SpriteRenderer**. You can do this while the demo is running, too!
3. Any changes you make in the `mapping-master/Assets/Resources/` folder will only be reflected the next time you hit **"PLAY"** to run the demo.
4. If you made some changes or fixes in `mapping-master/Assets/Resources/` you want to upload, copy these changes back into the corresponding **Google Drive** folder.
5. If you want to get the latest updates from **Google Drive**, repeat **STEP 3** of this tutorial. You might want to delete your `mapping-master/Assets/Resources/` folder first to prevent duplicate files from forming.
6. If you want to get the latest programming updates from my demo, repeat **STEP 2** of this tutorial.
